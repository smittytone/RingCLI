Usage:
  ringcli {COMMAND} [SUB-COMMAND] {REQUIRED VALUES} [FLAGS]

Commands:
  data       Access ring activity (steps, calories burned, distance moved) and heath data,
             including daily heart rate, blood oxygen (SpO2) and sleep records.
  utils      Scan for nearby rings, get specific ring info, including battery state,
             and perform housekeeping tasks such as flashing a ring's LED to help find it,
             bind the ring's address to a local store to save typing, set and enable periodic
             heart rate readings, set the ring's internal clock to (re)initialise the ring, and
             shut the ring down.

For more information on each command's array of sub-commands, run 'ringcli {COMMAND} --help'

All sub-commands other than 'ringcli utils scan' require the target ring's BLE address.
The 'scan' sub-command will get this for you. Use the 'bind' sub-command to retain this value
locally so you need not enter it again unless you have multiple rings. Only one ring can be
bound to a local machine. This is not a pairing process: it is simply a convenience feature.
